# /aida-doctor

Use this skill when the operator suspects AIDA's coordination substrate has drifted: leases left behind after an agent exits, pending briefs for shipped specs, worktrees with no lease, branches with no PR, stale cache lock-info sidecars, or specs whose status no longer matches active work.

## Workflow

1. Run the read-only diagnostic first:

   ```bash
   aida doctor
   ```

2. If the operator wants a narrower view, focus one category:

   ```bash
   aida doctor check stale-leases
   aida doctor check OBE-briefs
   aida doctor check stale-locks
   ```

3. Heal safe categories only after reading the report:

   ```bash
   aida doctor --heal
   ```

4. Use batch mode only when the operator explicitly asks for cleanup without prompts:

   ```bash
   aida doctor --heal --yes
   ```

5. Branch deletion is intentionally stronger:

   ```bash
   aida doctor heal orphan-branches --yes --force
   ```

## Safety Rules

- Never remove a worktree manually before checking whether `aida doctor` saved a salvage patch.
- Any doctor heal that removes a worktree must first write `.aida/salvage/<spec-id>-<agent>-attempt-<timestamp>.patch` when uncommitted work exists.
- Treat diagnostic-only categories as routing advice, not permission to improvise destructive cleanup.
- If the report says branch deletion is manual, ask the operator before deleting anything.

## JSON Mode

For advisor scripting or automation:

```bash
aida doctor --json
aida doctor --heal --yes --json
```

JSON output includes `findings` and, when healing, `healed` action records.
